## Overview

This application is used as a detailed information hub for different citys in the US, simply search what city you want to view and the citys name, LAT and LON, and an image of the city will appear after hitting the Explore button.

## Getting Started

To build a similar application, the user must install all the necessary terminal add ons, use a text editor (such as vs code) that can import react and bootstrap.

## Architecture

In this application, we used React JS along with bootstrap and React-Bootstrap, as well as basic css styling.
